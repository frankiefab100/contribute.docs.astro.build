description: A guide to adding and updating Astro's error messages in Astro Docs.
---

The source code for Astro's error messages is located in https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/core/errors/errors-data.ts . The English error pages are then automatically generated and imported into Astro's documentation. 

## Error writing guide

The guide for writing errors is located at https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/core/errors/README.md .
Here you will find information on the proper formatting, writing style, and more.


## Translations

Only translations of the error pages should be edited in docs directly. All changes to English errors (new errors, updates, typo fixes etc.) should be made in the above file.
